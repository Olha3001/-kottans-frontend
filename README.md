## Git та GitHub

I listened to the course **Introduction to Git and GitHub** for 1-2 weeks. It was a big mistake to do this after the pell-request was done. I brought for myself knowledge on -
* Git commit -a last commit when you are sure you won't change anything
* Git rm - deleting an untracked file
* Git mv - renaming a commit
* Git checkout can also cancel a command before the last snapshot
* Dash -p check not the whole file, but some changes - git reset dash -p
* Git revert - rollback - create a new commit reversed erroneous (you can git revert+ID)
* Git log (num) for example 2 - see the last 2 entries

Completed all levels [learngitbranching.js.org:]

* This course gave an understanding of the basics of git , its main commands. As well as understanding the branching of commits in git repositories
* It was interesting to go through the tutorial and see how the commands are executed.

Will I continue to use the knowledge gained in this course? - Definitely yes.

### Git for 30 quills

This course provides a minimum, initial knowledge


## Linux CLI, and HTTP


In this course, it was also interesting to go through the game to see how the teams work in action. Some of these commands I've seen before with git
